				<h2>The City</h2>
				<img id="cardiff" src="cardiff.jpg" width="500" alt="Cardiff city">
				<p>Cardiff is the capital and the largest city in Wales, it has more than adequate shops, nightlife and the Millennium Stadium. Though, it is compact and manageable, getting around is quick and easy, you can get all of the facilities expected of any modern capital but without any stress, everything is within walking distance. It is also well connected to the rest of the country by train.</p>
				<p>Additionally, it is one of the most competitive and, at the same time, affordable cities in the UK. Perfect for students, the Welsh capital has more green space per person than any core UK city. Wherever you are, a park or garden is never far away!</p>
