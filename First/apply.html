				<h2>How to apply</h2>
				<p>We encourage you to apply at least one month prior to entry so that we have enough time to process your application. If you are also applying for funding or will require a visa then we strongly recommend you apply as early as possible. We may consider late applications if we have places available, but you should contact the relevant Admissions Office for advice first.</p>
				<p>All applicants are required to submit a personal statement that outlines the reasons for applying, and at least one reference letter from a previous tutor or person in charge of a past professional experience. Work experience within the media or creative industries would be beneficial.</p>
				<p>Please apply via the University's <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/regis/general/applyonline/index.html" target="_blank">Online Application Service</a>.</p>

				<p>Applicants should have a UK 2:1 honours degree or its equivalent if outside the UK, in a relevant subject. If English is not your first language, you must have one of the following qualifications as evidence of your spoken and written English:</p>

			<ul id="List">
				<li>IELTS score of 7 (at least 6.0 in each module)</li>

				<li>PTE(A) score of 67 (at least 56 in each of the Communicative Skills sections)</li>
				<li>CPE Grade B; CAE Grade A</li>
			</ul>

				<p>However, applicants with an IELTS score of 6.5 (with a minimum subscore of 6.0 in each component) will be considered. This requirementmay be waived if the applicant can furnish sufficient evidence that they are suitably proficient in the use of English.</p>
