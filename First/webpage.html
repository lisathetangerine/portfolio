				<h2>Programme overview</h2>
				<p>Cardiff University is pleased to present a new Master programme which feautures the collaboration between the School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies and the School of Computer Science and Informatics. This full-time MSc will focus on the development of knowledge and skills through research-informed learning in digital journalism, data science, computer coding and digital development. It doesn't replace traditional journalism, but it targets a new market for people able to code and understand core principles of journalism as well.
				<p>Students will also benefit from a dedicated programme of seminars to harmonise their skills and understanding across these two different disciplines and to bring together the issues arising from the existing teaching modules.</p>

				<h2>Career opportunities</h2>
				<p>Postgraduate study can help you improve your job prospects, change your career direction or allow you to pursue further academic study. This MSc in particular aims to enable students to acquire specialist knowledge of journalism and computer science, to negotiate the multiplicity of social and cultural complexities encountered in creating public communication and have a strong understanding of the technology skills required to develop digital media. Moreover, it encourages students to solve complex problems and make decisions through identifying issues, evaluating options and reviewing outcomes.</p>
				<p>The course will prepare for employment into the digital media and digital journalism, particularly focussing on data journalism, newsroom development and more widely within the creative industries and start-ups focussed on digital media products.</p>
				<p>You will benefit from both the subject specific skills you will develop during your course, and from its award by a highly regarded University. This is reflected in our <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/for/prospective/postgraduate/taught/prospects.html" target="_blank">graduate employment record</a>.</p> <!-- the previous link opens a new window -->
