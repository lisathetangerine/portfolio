						<p>Despite the good progress made by local authorities, 32,000 were the incidents recorded in Wales during 2014 and 2015. Moreover, the database <a href="statswales.wales.gov.uk/Catalogue/Environment-and-Countryside/Fly-tipping">Fly-capture</a> records only incidents which occur on public land, which means the true scale of fly-tipping is even bigger.</p>
						<p><b>Fly-tipping is a crime.</b> Its offence is set out in the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/43/contents">Environmental Protection Act 1990</a>. In 2014, new guidelines on sentencing for environmental offences were issued, being the punishment of offenders not always a deterrent to commit the offence.</p>
						<p>Since then, fines reflect the true cost of fly-tipping on society. In April, a skip hire firm in South Wales was ordered <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-36054675">to pay £180,000</a> for dumping thousands of tonnes of waste illegally.</p>
						<p><b>Fly-tipping is more than a national problem.</b> It is not confined to geographical boundaries, and that's why Wales, Scotland and England are working together to tackle it.</p>

		    		<h3>The highest number of fly-tipping incidents occurs in South Wales.</h3>
		    		<p>Ryondda Cyhon Taff leads the way, followed respectively by Swansea, Cardiff and Caephilly, which is not surprising considering they contain high populated towns.</p> 
		    		<p>A formula to locate it could be <b>"more waste, less distance"</b>:</p>
		    		<p class="quote">«It's all about how much waste could be dumped and how far you are from that. We get most fly-tipping within a relatively short distance of large population centres where most waste is generated.» (D. Rounding - Enforcement Waste)</p>
		    		<p>However, if we think there is a merely correlation between the numbers of accidents and the population density, we are wrong. Data show high figures for Northern local authorities such as Isle of Anglesey and Denbighsire, which ranks low on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Welsh_principal_areas_by_population>density table.</a></p>
		    		<p>Furthermore, looking at the map, what strikes the most are the figures for localities like Wrexham, Monmouthshire and Ceredigion. In fact, summing together their values, they don't even account for 0,1% of the flytipping rates in Wales.</p>
		    		<p>Fly-tipping varies across Wales, and partly depends on the resources invested by local authorities.

			    	<h3>Since 2006, incidents have dropped by 42,2%.</h3>
		    		<p>That's mostly due to a shift in <b>Cardiff</b>'s figures. In fact, even if Wales' capital comes in third place, it saw his figures halved in the last year and markedly fell by 82% over an eight-year period.  Same trend applies for Vale of Glamorgan, but data dip by a factor of three.
		    		<p>However, out of all 22 local authorities, only a dozen of them tended to decrease over time.</p>
		    		<p>At the top of the graph, we find also <b>Swansea</b> and <b>Ryondda Cynon Taff</b>, whose numbers gradually rose over the last four years. Other local authorities with an upward trend are Isle of Anglesey and Denbighshire in the North, and Blaenau Gwent in the South.</p>

This seems due to the fact that people appear to dump rubbish in the streets without fear of prosecution.</p>
					<p>Flintshire, Powis and Bridgend saw a strong fluctuation, to later come back to approximately the same figures as 2006.</p>

			    	<h3>2/3 of incidents are from Household, of which 31% are black bags.</h3>
			    	<p>A report by the London-wide Initiative on Fly-tipping identified four types of fly-tippers:
		    		<ul id="fly-tippers">
				    	<li>Organised criminal fly-tippers - fly-tip for financial reward;</li>
					    <li>Commercial fly-tippers - fly-tip to avoid disposal charges;</li>
					    <li>Domestic fly-tippers - fly-tip to avoid inconvenience;</li>
					    <li>Travellers - accused of more dumping than they actually do</li>
					</ul></p>
					<p>Nevertheless, the main perpetrators of this environmental crime remain irresponsible residents and commercial fly-tippers.</p>
					<p>While the number of black bags has been halved from 2009, the same cannot be said for "other household". Still, this should not surprise much - just think of the rise in the incidents recorded over <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/wales/2015-12-02/charity-warns-over-fly-tipping-increase-during-christmas-holidays/">last Christmas</a>. People replace furnitures, toys, clothes with new gifts and tend to carelessly dump the old stuff in the streets.</p>
			    	<p>Other commonly tipped wastes in decreasing order include: construction and demolition waste, white goods and green waste.</p>

					<h3>It's estimated that fly-tipping costed tax-payers over £1.7 million in clean-up last year.</h3>
					<p>Fly-tipping affects council tax budget and uses money that could have better been spent elsewhere. The scatterplot reveals a markedly decrease in the number for Cardiff, while the general trend for the other local authorities has significantly oscillated.</p>
					<p>Two additional economical impacts there are quite often overlooked are:</p>
					<p>Fly-tipping costs around £105 in landfill tax and gate fees to dispose of one tonne waste.</p>
					<p>Fly-tipping hotspots are subject to arson attacks because of the large amount of tyres and gas bottles. This estimates the price of £1,970 in average per call out for the Fire and Rescue Services.</p>

					<h3>Still a minority think it is ok to dispose waste irresponsibly<h3>
					<p>We conducted a survey to understand attitudes towards fly-tipping. A total of 70 people (35 males and 35 females) with different age, social backgrounds and education level participated.</p>
					<p>What we found out is that the main reasons for fly-tipping are mostly laziness and sometimes money:</p>
					<p class="quote">«We provide excellent facilities that could be used. But there are people who have to pay and are reluctant.» (David Rounding - Enforcement Waste officer)</p>
					<div class="border">
						<h4>What people think</h4>
						<p class="piccolo"><i>"It's a selfish thing to do because everyone else ends up paying for the clean up through taxes."</i></p>
						<p class="piccolo"><i>"Appalling. Illegal. Bad for environment."</i></p>
						<p><i>"Should carry custodial sentence"</i></p>
						<p><i>"It's incredibly antisocial and disrespectful."</i></p>

		    		<ul id="yes">
				    	<li><b>3</b> do not care about the environment</li>
					    <li><b>4</b> do not like out-door activities,</li>

					    <li><b>6</b> do not recycle,</li>
					    <li><b>7</b> do litter.</li>
					</ul></p>
					<p>Fly-tippers justified their action blaming the lack in the rubbish collection service and the council ineffective waste policies. Moreover, some of them found it useful when objects can be re-used, because you can take and give away stuff that way. <i>"I once found a working telly in my home street"</i>, confessed one of the guy. </p>

					<h3>«Local authorities classified dump waste differently»</h3>
					<p>About people who leave stuff outside their property hoping that someone will rescue them, Rouding said:</p>
					<p class="quote">«I wouldn't call that action fly-tipping. That's a sanction 46 and I've never prosecuted it. But if they drive down the road and chuck it on the verge of somebody else property, then it becomes a sanction 44 and that's considered fly-tipping.»</p>
					<p>According to him, we should be quite skeptical about the figures we find on Fly-capture. It seems that many councils reach such high numbers because they score as fly-tipping things that are not essentially such. Even an action like leaving a bag of rubbish beside the bin on a collection day is considered fly-tipping somewhere.</p>
					<p class="quote">«Sometimes we do not view things as fly-tipping, which they do in other counties. I can't tell you what the exact difference is, but people don’t record it in the same way. If you look at the data for Northampton, it is far more higher than the one we have here in Buckinghamshire, but that's just because they classify fly-tipping differently.»</p>
					<p>The same argument can be applied on prosecution numbers.</p>

					<h2>Data don't always tell the truth</h2>
					<h4>Fly-tipping prosecution outcomes in 2014-2015</h4>
					<div id="pieChart"></div>
					<!-- <div id="chart"></div> -->
					<p>The Welsh prosecutions number is vastly outnumbered by the English one. In Wales only 105 prosecutions were recorder last year, while in England numbers were 94% higher than that, with local authorities carrying 1810 prosecutions.</p>
					<p>However, we can’t just rely on data. We should bear in mind, especially when are in front of big numbers, that many local authorities include in their figures things there are not actual prosecution.</p>					
					<p class="quote">«I suspect the councils with the biggest prosecutions numbers, they are either moving mountains or they are (11:15). We are a very robust prosecutive authority and we convict in average of one a week. Every local authority that says that it convicts more than 60 prosecutions per year is lying.» (D. Rounding)</p>

					<h2>Enforcement can be a solution</h2>
					<p>The Enforcement Waste team investigates fly-tipping. They analyse data, examine waste to understand where it comes from, speak with witnesses who saw people dumping waste and hide cameras to catch people dumping illegally. Their hidden cameras could be set to record videos, but they are not because they get a better resolutions with images.</p>

					<p class="quote">"We have shown that Enforcement can work, we have less dumping than we did and we have saved lots of money because of that."</p>
					<p>As shown for English data, Enforcement makes a big difference. Wales should invest more in a range of innovative surveillance techniques and enforcement measures to catch fly-tippers.</p>
